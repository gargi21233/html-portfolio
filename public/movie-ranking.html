<h1>The Best Movies according to Gargi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all the time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Work It</h3>
<p> It has been one of my favourite movies because I relate to it the most. The main character is somewhat similar to me, who does not know how to dance at all. She is not able to feel the music and vibe of it but want to so she learns inspite of so many difficulties to get into her dream college.</p>

<h3>Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani</h3>
<p>This is my another favourite movie and not just me, it is favourite movie of so so so many young Indians. It's a great movie about friendship and life.</p>

<h3>Andhadhun</h3>
<p>This movie is mystery and thriller. It is really a very well scripted and shot movie. At every scene our heart pounds at another level thinking what will happen next.</p>
